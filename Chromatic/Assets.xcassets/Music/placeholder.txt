Please add your .mp3 or .wav song files to this directory.
Make sure to add this "Music" folder to your app's target in Xcode under "Build Phases" -> "Copy Bundle Resources".

For example, if you add "song1.mp3" here, the PlaylistManager will attempt to load it.

This placeholder is here because the AI agent cannot directly add binary audio files.
